# Capstone Theme
Story API Logger

## Project Concept
The main theme of my capstone project is a story API logger. 
The main reason why I chose that theme is because I began to write Webtoon/Manga stories since
2023 and I really love creating these types of stories/oneshots and a API logger will help me see the status of 
each of my projects and will help keep track on which story is in development, is ready for an artist to 
draw or is ready to be published. Another reason why I chose that theme for my capstone is because it 
will help me with creating my personal portfoilo and will have real-world application for me.


## Scope and Functionality
For the API endpoints, I'll have to have at least five endpoints. Since each project status is constantly changing using a NoSQL based database, it will be used. Since my stories are split into different 'arcs’, more endpoints will have to be created to accumulate the extra layer of information. 

### Estimation Endpoints

Two GET methods

One POST method

Two PUT methods

One DELETE method

## Course Content Alignment
This project will use most of everything taught in this course (COMP-3018) as well as requiring some features for research. For example I want this API to be usable in Notion and would require some research for that to happen.

The project will have multiple controllers and branch as well as security validation since these projects are personal and heavily guarded secret to me. The endpoints, controllers and branches uses modules 1-2. The security validation will use modules 3-5. Most of the databases will use module 3 and external research to be applied. Since I use Google docs for writing my stories and notion to semi-track the progress creating an API to track both simultaneously will help my writing process. Doing research on how to use Notion for that will be the final challenge but not a final project requirement for this.
